  <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio site.</p> 
  <p>I am an Ohio native that has lived in several states all over the country. I have been a zookeeper for almost a decade, and most recently a veterinary technician. During the pandemic, I returned to zookeeping but really starting thinking about a new career that would continue to challenge me and for years to come. I have always been interested in how and why things work, which led me to investigating web development and then Nashville Software School. It has been an inspiring experience that will prepare me for the new and challenging roles that lie ahead.</p>
